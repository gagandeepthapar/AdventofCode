# Advent of Code
This repository is a way for me to practice different programming languages and techniques with a set of challenges.

My goal for each day is not to develop is most perforamtive/quickest/memory efficient method to solve the problem, but to implement a solution that is highly readable, manageable, and modular. It's a way to practice skills I picked up while writing software for a larger audience that needs to be easy to pick up and understand what is happening and why including a full set of test cases based on the expected output.

Currently looking to practice Python, C++, and Rust!
